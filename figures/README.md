## Figures

Figures with **\*\_dist_effect_sizes.png** extension display the distribution of effect sizes for phenotype0 vs phenotype1. The plot also includes whether the mutation is fixed or not, the correlation for mutations that fixed and those that didn't, and the variance-covariance matrix provided to the simulation


Figures with **\*\_mut_effect_allchrom.png** extension display where m2 mutations rise in the genome, their effect direction (positive or negative), and their effect size for each phenotype.

Figures with **\*\_mut_effect_chromx.png** extension display where m2 mutations rise on the xth chromosome, their effect direction (positive or negative), and their effect size for each phenotype.


Figures with **\*\_phen_env_corr.png** extension display the change in the phenotype-environment correlation over time for all PhenEnv files in the results subdirectory.
